# drawing_with_turtles
A series of python exercises to explore constructing 2D images, iteratively and recursively.
Completed in a CS class with Professor Jim Fix at Reed College, 2014.

In this assignment, I write the file turtle_draw to work through a series of drawing challenges using a Turtle object that constructs a Turtle Pen on a canvas. An instantiated Turtle can change direction (angles measured in degrees), shift its pen to be on or off the canvas, and move forward a given number of units.

Exercies 1 through 8 each present functions that draw specific images when given various parameters:

  Ex. 1: A hexagon of variable length.
  
  Ex. 2: A grid of variable shapes in variable positions.

  Ex. 3: A polygon maker -- give this function n number of sides, and it returns a function that creates a polygon of n sides
 
  Ex. 4: A star maker -- give this function n numer of sides, and it returns a function that draws a star of n sides
 
  Ex. 5: A circle of variable radius.
 
  Ex. 6: An arc of a given length carved from a circle of a given radius.
 
  Ex. 7: A flower with n number of petals.
 
  Ex. 8: A Koch snowflake, constructed recursively. Read more about the Koch snowflake here:
